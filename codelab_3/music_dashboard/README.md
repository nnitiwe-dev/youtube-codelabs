## üí° **Recommended Improvement: Enhanced Data Loading**

The current version of the app fetches data directly from **Kworb.net** each time it runs, which can be **slow** and **unreliable** if the website changes its structure.

To **optimize load times** and handle **network failures gracefully**, consider the following improved `load_data` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import os

CACHE_DIR = "cache"
os.makedirs(CACHE_DIR, exist_ok=True)

def load_data(url, table_index=0, filename="cached_data.csv", refresh=False):
    """
    Loads data from a URL and caches it as a CSV file for faster reloads.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL to fetch data from.
        table_index (int): The index of the HTML table to parse.
        filename (str): Local filename to cache the data.
        refresh (bool): Whether to refresh the cache.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The loaded DataFrame.
    """
    cache_path = os.path.join(CACHE_DIR, filename)
    
    if os.path.exists(cache_path) and not refresh:
        print(f"Loading data from cache: {cache_path}")
        return pd.read_csv(cache_path)
    
    print(f"Fetching data from URL: {url}")
    df = pd.read_html(url)[table_index]
    df.to_csv(cache_path, index=False)
    return df
```

### **Usage**

```python
spotify_artists = load_data(
    "https://kworb.net/spotify/artists.html", 
    table_index=0, 
    filename="spotify_artists.csv"
)
```

### **Benefits:**

1. **Faster Loading Times:** Cached data is loaded instantly on subsequent runs.
2. **Offline Access:** If the URL is temporarily down, the app still functions.
3. **Automatic Updates:** Use the `refresh=True` flag to fetch new data:

   ```python
   spotify_artists = load_data("https://kworb.net/spotify/artists.html", refresh=True)
   ```

Would you like me to refactor the **music\_dashboard.py** to use this improved loader and make it more efficient?
