### `YouTube-CodeLabs`

Welcome to the companion repo for my YouTube tutorial series! This repository is packed with practical, beginner-friendly codelabs that bring AI and coding concepts to life. From extracting job applicant details with OpenAI’s Function Calling (think resume parsing into JSON) to automating real-world tasks, you’ll find working code, sample datasets, and step-by-step guides here. 

Dive into projects like:
- **Resume Parser**: Turn messy CVs into structured data for databases.
- More AI-powered goodies coming soon!

Pair this with my [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@nnitiwe) for a full walkthrough. Fork, clone, or contribute—let’s build something awesome together!
